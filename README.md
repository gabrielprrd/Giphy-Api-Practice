#Gabriska's Gif Searcher

This is just a simple practice using the Giphy API where the user search for any word or term and the website displays a list of gifs or stickers.

## SweetAlert2

The app uses SweetAlert2 to display some beautiful alerts easily. It was a good way to understand how packages work and saved me some time.

## Improving the app

I'm currently trying to make the css cleaner and transitioning the javascript to ES6, which I didn't know by the time I started this.

The next step is to allow the user to click on any gif and displays it bigger. I haven't decided if it will be in another page or ajax.

###### I don't pretend to spend much more time in this project because it's simple and there are lots of ideas and concepts I want to work on.
